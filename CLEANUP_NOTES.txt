## ClearComms - Codebase Cleanup Summary

### Files Removed:
- src/routes/tray-menu/+page.svelte (custom tray menu route - no longer needed)
- src/lib/components/TrayMenu.svelte (custom tray menu component - no longer needed)

### Code Cleaned Up:
- Removed tray-menu window configuration from tauri.conf.json
- Removed custom transparent window logic from main.rs
- Removed debug console.log statements from native_menu.rs
- Changed println! to eprintln! for error messages in main.rs

### What Remains:
✅ Native Windows context menu implementation (src-tauri/src/native_menu.rs)
✅ System tray icon with left-click to toggle main window
✅ Right-click shows native Windows 11 context menu with:
   - Show ClearComms
   - Hide ClearComms  
   - Pin on top
   - Quit
✅ Automatic menu dismissal (handled by Windows)
✅ Windows 11 native styling (Mica/Acrylic effects)

### Benefits:
- Simpler codebase
- No custom transparent window complexity
- Native OS behavior and styling
- Automatic accessibility support
- Better performance
